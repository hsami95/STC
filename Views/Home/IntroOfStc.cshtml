            Building on an impressive history of accomplishment, the Directorate of Students Affairs
            (DSA) has always reinforced the commitment of the University of the Punjab for shaping
            a better future for individuals and the society. Our mission to impart knowledge for the
            betterment of the society is reflected through the gems of the University of the Punjab
            that represent this University all over Pakistan in co-curricular competitions.
            The University of the Punjab, since 2008, has risen as the Institute with the most laurels
            achieved and is setting great milestones for universities all over Pakistan. A huge number
            of brilliant students has actively contributed to and has been playing pivotal in the
            achievements of the DSA both directly and indirectly.<br /><br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Striving for excellence – in writing, public speaking, debating, singing, dramatics, and a
            variety of other co-curricular activities – remains the primary focus of DSA and has been
            vital in enhancing the repute of the university at national and international level. This
            office has been a body which supports students through every obstacle they might face
            during their term - be it pre-term orientation, co-curricular activities, or be it
            information-laden seminars on social issues.<br /><br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      It has been our divine duty to promote education with an extra advantage which would
            ensure better graduates with a better understanding for their future. University of The
            Punjab is proud of the creative, resourceful stars working in different fields and standing
            out amongst the best of the best.<br /><br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Our aspirations are high and we shall move forward in terms of outstanding
            performance. We shall not only build upon the areas of our strength, but also be
            confident and bold enough to make changes at the same time that will enable us to
            enhance our reputation and performance. We can only achieve our goals by striving for
            excellence in all our doings and by seeking every opportunity towards success<br /><br />

            

            Student Community is a very important segment of our society. A nation can never
            progress and achieve its goals unless it makes best use of its youth in the nation
            building. The process of learning and success never ends. Everyone needs resources,
            platform and healthy atmosphere to refine his/her capabilities. At university level,
            students mainly focus on their studies and rarely spare time to participate in cocurricular
            activities. It is the responsibility of the institution to provide them conducive
            atmosphere to enhance their skills. Moreover, these co-curricular activities play a
            pivotal role in the lives of students and enable them to face the upcoming challenges
            with confidence, discipline and national commitment.<br /><br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Directorate of Students Affairs is committed to promote co-curricular activities in the
            university under the patronage of the worthy Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Mujahid Kamran.
            This office organizes various competitions and programs for the university students
            throughout the year. Such healthy activities provide a base to find out the real talent.
            These talented students are enlightening the name of this prestigious university by
            securing top positions in different competitions at national and international level.<br /><br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      The high level of success has only been possible due to continuous encouragement and
            support by the worthy Vice Chancellor Punjab University, Prof. Dr. Mujahid Kamran.
            This booklet provides an overview of all remarkable performances and events of Punjab
            University students over the past few years till date.<br /><br />
